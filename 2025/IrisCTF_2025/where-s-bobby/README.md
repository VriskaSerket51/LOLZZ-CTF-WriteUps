`I took this picture while I was on a road trip. I distinctively remember that there was a body of water along this route, and there weren't many populated areas. Find the route number of the road I was on.

The flag is the route number and the 2-character abbreviation of the country it is in, seperated by an underscore (_). For example, if the route was route 23 in British Columbia, Canada, the flag would be irisctf{23_CA}.

If you close-up of the sign in the picture and translate Chinese, then you can know that it says "There's no traffic from 楼自庄村 to 西沙屯村". With saying that "a body of water along this route" in problem, we can know that the road is S3801 in China.


flag is: **irisctf{3801_CN}**
