# Checking Out of Winter

"We took our annual road trip to Baja California Sur to visit the beach and play some golf. I like how this location is farther from the city compared to other resorts. I really enjoyed the sweet and savory sauce on the pizza with shredded chicken. After eating, I fell asleep, and half of my legs ended up getting tanned."

With this things,
 - Baja California Sur
 - farther from the city
 - shape of building in image

we can know this place is 'Hilton_Los_Cabos_Beach_and_Golf_Resort' with google map. It takes some time to see all of road views.
